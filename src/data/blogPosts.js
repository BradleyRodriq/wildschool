      'El Yunque National Forest is the only tropical rainforest in the U.S. National Forest System—and it’s right here in Puerto Rico. For students, that means a living classroom: towering trees, endemic species, clean watersheds, and the chance to see how conservation works on the ground.',
      'On our El Yunque excursion, we don’t just walk the trails. We tie the visit to curriculum: biodiversity, water cycles, and the role of forests in climate and community. Students can contribute to real science by recording species, observing weather, or participating in simple data projects that researchers use.',
      'Whether you’re planning a first field trip or deepening a unit on ecosystems, El Yunque offers something you can’t get from a textbook. If you’d like to bring your group, check out What We Offer and request a booking.',

    date: '2025-02-10',
    excerpt: 'A banana peel breaks down in weeks. A plastic bottle can last centuries. Teaching students about decomposition times can change how they think about waste and conservation.',

      'One of the most powerful lessons in conservation is simple: not everything “goes away” when we throw it away. A banana peel might decompose in a few weeks. A paper bag, a few months. A plastic bag? Decades. A plastic bottle? Hundreds of years. That timeline shocks many students—and it’s a great starting point for discussions about recycling, reducing waste, and taking care of the ocean and coast.',
      'In our talks on plastic and decomposition, we go beyond the numbers. We talk about where plastic ends up, how it affects marine life, and what students can do: refusing single-use when possible, recycling correctly, and spreading the word. When the same students join us on a beach or coastal excursion, they often make the connection themselves: “This is what we talked about.”',

    excerpt: 'When students collect real data and share it with scientists, they’re not just learning—they’re contributing. Here’s how we use citizen science on every excursion.',

      'Citizen science means people like your students—not only full-time scientists—collecting and sharing data that researchers use. Bird counts, water quality checks, species observations, beach cleanups with data: all of it can feed into real projects. For students, that’s a game-changer. They’re not just doing a worksheet; they’re part of something bigger.',
      'At Wild School Experience, we build citizen science into our excursions. In El Yunque, that might mean recording what we see and hear. On the coast, it might mean documenting what washes up or monitoring a small stretch of beach. The goal is to introduce students to the habits of science: careful observation, clear records, and the idea that their work can help protect the places they’re visiting.',
      'We also offer a dedicated talk on citizen science for educators and groups—what it is, how to get started, and how it fits into our programs. You’ll find it under Talks on our What We Offer page.',

    date: '2025-01-28',
    excerpt: 'The coast is one of the best classrooms for marine life, conservation, and hands-on science. Here’s why we love bringing students to Puerto Rico’s shores.',

      'Beaches and coastal ecosystems are perfect for student excursions: they’re accessible, full of life, and directly tied to topics like marine biology, pollution, and conservation. Here are five reasons we keep bringing groups to the coast.',
      'First, the ocean and shore are where many students first “see” marine science—waves, tides, crabs, birds, and sometimes the impact of plastic and debris. Second, beach and coastal trips naturally lead into conversations about stewardship: what we leave behind, how long it lasts, and what we can do. Third, the coast is ideal for simple citizen science: surveys, cleanups with data, or species observation. Fourth, the experience sticks: students remember the smell of the sea and the weight of what they found. Fifth, it connects to what we do in the classroom—our talks on marine life, recycling, and plastic make more sense once they’ve stood on the sand.',

      'Coffee has shaped Puerto Rico’s history, economy, and landscape. On our Coffee & Culture excursion, students see the full story: how coffee is grown, processed, and what “sustainable” can mean for a farm and a community. It’s a way to tie science, social studies, and real-world choices into one experience.',
      'We focus on the connection between farming and the environment—water, soil, shade, and wildlife—and how decisions on the farm affect the island. Students leave with a clearer picture of where their food (and drinks) come from and why supporting responsible practices matters.',
      'Our coffee excursion is one of several ways we introduce students to Puerto Rico beyond the textbook. You can find it under What We Offer alongside El Yunque, beach, birdwatching, and marine discovery.',

    excerpt: 'Marine conservation isn’t just for coastal schools. Here’s why we think every student benefits from understanding the ocean and what we can do to protect it.',

    body: [
      'The ocean affects weather, food, and the air we breathe. Plastic and pollution from anywhere can end up in the sea. So even if your school is far from the coast, marine conservation is relevant. When students understand how the ocean works and what threatens it, they’re better equipped to make choices and to care for the planet.',
      'We offer talks on marine life and conservation that work in any classroom—in person or virtual. We cover ecosystems, species, human impact, and what students can do: reduce plastic, recycle, and spread the word. For groups that can visit Puerto Rico, we combine these ideas with our Beach & Coastal Ecology and Marine Life & Conservation excursions so that learning happens in the field too.',

      'When students step outside the classroom, they don’t leave learning behind—they deepen it. In Puerto Rico, from El Yunque to the coast, outdoor learning ties conservation and citizen science to real places and hands-on discovery.',
      'Studies consistently link time in nature to better concentration, lower stress, and stronger motivation. At Wild School Experience, we design excursions so that students contribute to real science through observation and data while building a connection to the island’s ecosystems.',
